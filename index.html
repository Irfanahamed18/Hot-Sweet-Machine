  <h2>Our Process</h2>
  <div class="process-table">

    <div class="process-row">
      <div class="process-title">Step 1<br>Custom Container Selection</div>
      <div class="process-image"><img src="images/step1.jpg" alt="Container Selection"></div>
      <div class="process-text">
        We begin by selecting durable containers perfectly suited to become mobile food units. Each container is evaluated for strength and adaptability for machines like popcorn, oven, ice cream, and cotton candy setups.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="process-row">
      <div class="process-title">Step 2<br>Food-Grade Treatment & Planning</div>
      <div class="process-image"><img src="images/step2.jpeg" alt="Treatment & Planning"></div>
      <div class="process-text">
        Containers are cleaned and treated with food-safe coatings. We then plan the interior‚Äîwhether it's insulation for ice cream makers or ventilation for ovens‚Äîtailored to your selected machine type.

    </div>

    <div class="process-row">

      <div class="process-image"><img src="images/step3.jpeg" alt="Fabrication"></div>
