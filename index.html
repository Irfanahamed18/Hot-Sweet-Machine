  <h2>Our Process</h2>
  <div class="process-table">

    <div class="process-row">
      <div class="process-title">Step 1<br>Custom Container Selection</div>
      <div class="process-image"><img src="images/step1.jpg" alt="Container Selection"></div>
      <div class="process-text">
        We begin by selecting durable containers perfectly suited to become mobile food units. Each container is evaluated for strength and adaptability for machines like popcorn, oven, ice cream, and cotton candy setups.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="process-row">
      <div class="process-title">Step 2<br>Food-Grade Treatment & Planning</div>
      <div class="process-image"><img src="images/step2.jpeg" alt="Treatment & Planning"></div>
      <div class="process-text">
        Containers are cleaned and treated with food-safe coatings. We then plan the interior—whether it's insulation for ice cream makers or ventilation for ovens—tailored to your selected machine type.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="process-row">
      <div class="process-title">Step 3<br>Smart Structural Fabrication</div>
      <div class="process-image"><img src="images/step3.jpeg" alt="Fabrication"></div>
      <div class="process-text">
        We rebuild the container with proper frameworks. Machines like popcorn dispensers, candy floss drums, or ovens are installed with wiring, counters, and ventilation for efficient performance.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="process-row">
      <div class="process-title">Step 4<br>Aesthetic Branding & Finishing</div>
      <div class="process-image"><img src="images/step4.jpeg" alt="Branding"></div>
      <div class="process-text">
        After fabrication, we apply vibrant paint, branding, and lighting. Whether a bright cotton candy kiosk or a bold oven setup, your unit becomes an eye-catching showpiece.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="process-row">
      <div class="process-title">Step 5<br>Testing & On-Time Delivery</div>
      <div class="process-image"><img src="images/step5.jpeg" alt="Testing & Delivery"></div>
      <div class="process-text">
        Every unit is tested for performance and safety. Once approved, your fully equipped Hot and Sweet Machine is packed and delivered, ready to delight customers from day one.
